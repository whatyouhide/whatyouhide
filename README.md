# Hi 👋

I'm a software engineer, architect, public speaker, and [book
author][testing-elixir].

Italy 🇮🇹 is my home country (even though I have red hair 👨‍🦰), and I
currently live there.

I'm super-duper active in the **open-source world**, especially in the
@elixir-lang community.

  * 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 I'm a member of the Elixir core team, and I've helped develop the
    language since 2016.

  * 📚 I maintain several widely-used libraries for the Elixir ecosystem, such
    as a [Redis driver][redix], [GNU Gettext bindings][gettext], a [low-level
    HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 client][mint], and more.

I love the OSS community. If you want to stop by and say hi, need anything, or
if I can be of help in any way, head over to [andrealeopardi.com][website] to
find out how to reach me.
